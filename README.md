# AT&T vs Telcel Analysis

In this project I analyze wheter if **AT&T** is a better option than **Telcel** in **MÃ©xico** or the other way around.

There is an Excel book with the complete analysis and a jupyter notebook where I computed the minimun of the price that we can get mixing up the diferent kinds of recharges in the prepaid schema for AT&T.

> **Note:** Later I'll update this project to have the visualizations in python like a pro.

### Conclusion of the analysis

Overall, the conclusion is that, if the customer only cares about the value of his/her money, then the best option is to get the recharge of 150 MXN at AT&T because it's the **cheapest cost anually converted, has the best cost per MegaByte consumed and in comparison with Telcel you will spend the same amount in recharges (of 150 MXN) in a year, that is 2,100 MXN, but with AT&T you'll get 70% more MegaBytes in a year than with Telcel (ATT:47,600 MB per year; Telcel: 28,000 MB per year).** That's why I conclude that, in matter of money and MB, AT&T is a better option in prepaid schemas than Telcel. It is of matter to say that I didn't considered many other variables that includes a service of a company like: Customer Service, Coverage and Quality of the calls and internet of the company.
